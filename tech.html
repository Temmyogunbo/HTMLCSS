                </h2><br>
                <p>Snapchat has set up an international base in London and will book sales from outside of the US in the UK.

                  The move is a significant departure from other internet companies like Google and Facebook, which have registered the majority of their international advertising revenues in Ireland, as well as a boost to the British tech sector after the Brexit vote.

                  Snap, the photo-sharing app's parent company, said "the UK’s strong creative industries make this a great place to build a global business".

                <p>
                    Ten years ago I was running from San Francisco’s Moscone Centre to a nearby hotel to edit a piece for the Ten O’Clock News when my phone rang.
Those were the days, by the way, when phones were for making calls but all that was about to change.
“Have you got your hands on this new Apple phone for a piece to camera?” shouted a producer in London. “If not, why not?”
This appeared to be an impossible demand.
Steve Jobs had just unveiled the iPhone before an adoring crowd but it was not available for grubby hacks to manhandle.

                <p>
                    Facebook Inc launched its "Journalism Project" on Wednesday, as the world's biggest social media network looks to deepen its relationship with news organizations.

The launch comes less than a week after the company said it was hiring former CNN reporter, anchor and host Campbell Brown to lead its news partnerships team.

As part of the new project, Facebook said on Wednesday it would focus on improving its current storytelling formats such as Live, 360, and Instant Articles.

                    Canada's Shaw Communications Inc (SJRb.TO) announced a voice-controlled television product on Wednesday that it hopes will help it stem years of market share losses to western Canadian telecom rival Telus Corp (T.TO).

The product, named BlueSky TV, is available in Calgary and will expand to other markets in coming months, Shaw said in a statement.
