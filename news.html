                    Washington D.C. [U.S.], Jan. 11 : United States President Barack Obama said goodbye to his nation today in an emotional address enriched with wisdom and optimism, asserting that he would never give up on his vision for change and reminding Americans that they made him a better leader.

"This is where I learned that change only happens when ordinary people get involved, get engaged, and come together to demand it," Obama said from a packed hall of supporters in his adopted hometown.

India on Wednesday demanded apology from retail giant, Amazon, for selling doormats featuring its national flag.

It warned that it would cancel visas of company officials unless the products were withdrawn.

External Affairs Minister, Sushma Swaraj, intervened in the issue after she was tagged by a Twitter user with a screenshot of Amazon’s Canada website selling the product.
